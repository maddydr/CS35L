To find the IDs for this exact change, I ran the initial command git log | grep "merge-tree" which output results of everything containing the text merge-tree. I refined my search to be git log --grep "git merge-tree" and parsed the previous commits until I found the one with the same description. This revealed

    Merge branch 'js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo' into maint-2.38
    
    In read-only repositories, "git merge-tree" tried to come up with a
    merge result tree object, which it failed (which is not wrong) and
    led to a segfault (which is bad), which has been corrected.
    
    * js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo:
      merge-ort: return early when failing to write a blob
      merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories

But this is a merge file and we desire the original file. To find the original file I went on the Github website and found the corresponding patch which revealed this

    merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories
    
    If the blob/tree objects cannot be written, we really need the merge
    operations to fail, and not to continue (and then try to access the tree
    object which is however still set to `NULL`).
    
    Let's stop ignoring the return value of `write_object_file()` and
    `write_tree()` and set `clean = -1` in the error case.

which tells us our desired information.
