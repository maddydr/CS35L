First I ran grep -n "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information" *
to find out the line number and which file this statement was in. I got the output 
northamerica:900:# and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."
I then knew the line was in the file northamerica. I ran 
git blame -L 900 northamerica
To find the commit history of line 900 in this file. I got the output:
c8f960ec7 (Paul Eggert        2013-09-02 08:09:06 -0700  900) # and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."

c12b43274 (Arthur David Olson 1995-12-21 11:43:42 -0500  904) # Other than Indianapolis, the Indiana place names are so nondescript
â€¦ 

This revealed the commit hash of the desired change to be c8f960ec7. Running
git show c8f960ec7 I saw the commit comment that it was a change to move links back to primary files.

I instead ran 
git log -S "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information." northamerica

And saw that Arthur David Olson was the author of this change.
